# Lead-Conversion-Prediction
World Plus, a mid-sized private bank, sought to enhance its lead conversion rates for its new term deposit product. To achieve this goal, data mining was implemented to predict customer conversion likelihood.

Our data mining approach involves data preparation, feature selection, and model building. Data preparation ensured data integrity and consistency, while feature selection identified the most relevant predictors of lead conversion. Predictive models, including decision trees, random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM), and logistic regression, were evaluated using threshold discriminator and graphical-based metrics. Each model evaluation reveals the accuracy of each approach in identifying potential converters.
